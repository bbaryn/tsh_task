# A few notes for the reviewer

Several unit tests have been written. I think this is enough to show what I can do and how I write them. If more of them are required to be written, adding e2e, please contact me.

I used NestJS because it was not excluded in the task content. In addition, this framework makes the work easier (I can also write code in pure NodeJS + express).
